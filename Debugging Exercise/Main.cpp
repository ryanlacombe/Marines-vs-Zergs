// Marines are trying to "de-bug" an area (haha . . . haha)
// However something's up with this code . . . figure out what's going wrong
// When you're finished, there should be no compiler errors or warnings
// The encounter should also run and finish correctly as per the rules in the comments

// In many cases there are differences between what's in otherwise identical sections
// for Marines and Zerglings. It's good to be able to tell what the differences are
// and why they might be important.

// What's efficient and inefficient? Why?
// What uses more memory and what doesn't? Why?
